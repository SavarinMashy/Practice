for i in range(10):
    print(i**2)
    
# for the problem statment, square of a number 
# so the power operator ** is used but I can
# improve readability and character count with 
# i*i instead of i**2 but both result in the same
# thing. However i*i does not scale for greater powers
# example: i**4 is better than i*i*i*i

# range(count) end before the count
# steps through sequence of items default step is 1
# starts on specifed number ends before stop value
# tune range() --> range(start, stop, step)
